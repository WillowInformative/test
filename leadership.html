Diaz</strong><br>Founder and Principal, Willow Informative Services, LLC
</p><p>With over two decades of experience supporting national security missions, Iâ€™ve had the honor of leading programs and teams that deliver results where they matter most, in complex, high-stakes environments across defense and intelligence operations.
</p><p>I began my career serving on Active Duty and in the Virginia Army National Guard as a Military Police Officer, including multiple deployments in support of the Global War on Terrorism. After transitioning from uniformed service, I continued supporting the mission as a defense contractor and later as an Army Civilian. Eventually, I moved into the corporate sector, supporting strategic growth and program management efforts for defense and intelligence clients.
</p><p>I founded Willow Informative Services because I believe there is a better way to support organizations doing meaningful work. I wanted to create a firm grounded in values, not just deliverables. A company that brings structure to complexity, offers honest insight, and works closely with clients to solve hard problems.
</p><p>I approach every engagement with the belief that meaningful change begins by respecting the work already being done. My role is not to replace what exists, but to listen, understand, and help strengthen and amplify it. I support teams as they grow, adapt, and lead through complexity with confidence.
</p><p>I believe in true partnership, where trust and perspective lead to lasting impact. Real transformation happens when we combine shared purpose with a clear path forward, bridging the gap between vision and mission execution.
</p><p></strong><br>Together we can do great things!
